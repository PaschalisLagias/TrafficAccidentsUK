# TrafficAccidentsUK
Data analysis and machine learning project using traffic accident data from the 
Department for Transport.

## Project Outline:
* Data merging for years 2005 - 2018.
* Data merging for year 2019.
* Exploratory analysis.
* Check for missing values.
* Computation of data correlation.
* Data corrections based on Department for Transport documentation.
* Data imputation for 2005 - 2018.
* Data imputation for 2019.
* Test of supervised learning method (multi-layered perceptron with class weights) for prediction of casualty severity.
* Test of reinforcement learning method (Q network with reward function) for prediction of casualty severity.
